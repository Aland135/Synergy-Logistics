A data analysis program designed to help Synergy Logistics, a fictional company that wishes to establish a strategy for the next year of operations.
Synergy Logistics is in the business of imports and exports all over the world. 
They wish to know wether they can focus only on their 10 most demanded routes or not.
They also wish to know which are their most profitable transport modes, and which one they can remove.
Their final request is to know which countries generate them 80% of their total revenue, to focus on them.
A csv file was provided with over 19000 rows of data and 10 different columns, from where conclusions were obtained. 
Python was used for the code, and the analysis was carried out making use of dataframes by using pandas. 
Seaborn as well as matplotlib were also used to plot the results to facilitate their visualization. 
The program also generates csv files with dataframes filtered by the requests of Synergy Logistics.
